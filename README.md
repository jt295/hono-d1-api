# Hono + D1 API on a cloudflare worker

## Brief

Setting up a basic Next.js project (in Typescript) that showcases client and server components in React 18.

Participants will bring their laptop, a node and git installation, and a working knowledge of React.

### The workshop will cover

#### Background info (brief covering of each point)

- Downsides and challenges of fully client side applications
- The benefits of Server rendered applications
- Covering SSR, ISR, and SSG - where and why you would want to use what
- Progressive enhancement - what it is and why it matters

#### Interactive coding element

- Basic scaffolding of a Next.js app
- Run through of how routing works
- How to pull data from a (mock) CMS to populate React components and pages
- Creating dynamic routes and sections

#### --- Bonus content ---

- Generating static pages at build time
- Streaming content with suspense
- Creating an API route
- Creating a form and server actions
- Optimistic updates with useOptimistic
- Deploying to Azure
- Database integration
- Github repo will be provided with instructions and branches with each step complete in advance so people can move at different paces during the workshop.

Not all Engineers are likely to be experienced in TypeScript so will be on hand to assist with this element. I am not expecting anyone to finish all of the steps during the workshop, and hopefully participants will be inspired to continue with the exercises in their own time

## "CMS" plan

- Todo list functionality
- Hard code a few routes
- Posts
  - CRUD
  - Title, description, image, id, content, author
- Products
  - CRUD
  - Title, description, cost, image, id
